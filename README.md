# Fundgrube

A lightweight, static and beautifully styled web gallery for your giveaway items. Built with Vite, Vanilla JS, and CSS Grid. Includes local shell scripts to automatically resize images and scaffold items.

## How it works
1. Dump your original images into the `incoming/` directory.
2. Run the `process_mac.sh` (or `process_win.ps1` on Windows) batch script inside the `incoming/` directory.
   - Images are automatically resized (max 800px) and copied to `public/items/`.
   - A `.yaml` template file is generated alongside each picture in `public/items/`.
3. Edit the generated `.yaml` files in `public/items/` to give your items a title, description, tags, and product link.
4. Preview locally using `npm run dev`.
5. Push to GitHub! The GitHub Actions pipeline will bundle everything into a static site (`items.json` generated on the fly) and deploy to GitHub Pages.

## YAML Format
Fundgrube supports multiple items per picture. Simply list them as an array in the YAML file.

```yaml
- title: "Laptop"
  description: "Working well, minor scratches."
  productlink: "https://amazon.com/laptop"
  tags:
    - Electronics
    - Laptop
- title: "Laptop Bag"
  description: "Fits 15-inch laptops."
  productlink: ""
  tags: 
    - Accessory
```

## Running locally
To start the Vite development server to preview your changes in real-time:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
```
*(Running build once is recommended to ensure `items.json` is generated before dev starts, though Vite handles assets during dev, `items.json` is strictly generated by our pre-build node script!)*
To manually regenerate `items.json` without building Vite:
```bash
node build_index.js
```

## Deploying
This project includes a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file. Just create a GitHub repository, push your `main` branch, and enable GitHub Actions/Pages. Your static site will be automatically deployed and updated every push.
